Source code for our application.
Development process has been rough due to no prior experience with C# or android development let alone bluetooth. Connection procedure has undergone many changes, but I settled with querying the host device for paired devices and retviewing the the wanted device via its name.
The search and connection attempt is only made once every time the "Search" button is pressed. It would be nice to implement some saving features for the connection but I think I've wandered far enough from the cources main subject already. The communication is also really simple (only one byte) and one way, because we only need information about a single pushbutton from the app.
