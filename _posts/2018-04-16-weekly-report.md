# Week Four

### Ville:
Our plan is to 3D print the container of our design. I exported the model of the container into an STL file and went to FabLab to preview it. The model turned out to be fine apart from the ridiculous printing time and cost. The model would have taken 15 hours to print and cost approximately 150 â‚¬. To be continued... :-)
