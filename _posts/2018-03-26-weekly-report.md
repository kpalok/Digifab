# Weeks 1-3

Weeks one to two we had the introductory lectures and hadn't formed a group yet.
on week three we formed our group and met up to discuss about what should our artifact be, made some initial sketches and composed the introductory report.
After agreeing on the subject we registered our group and begun setting up the repository and documentation website.
