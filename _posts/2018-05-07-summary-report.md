# Week Nine; Summary report.

Our concept didn't change much along the way, only design choices were how to fabricate the actual food container and how the release mechanism should be designed. 
![Image missing.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpalok/Digifab/gh-pages/Images/ContainerProtoBooth.jpg "Container") *Initial idea was to 3D print the whole container, but it would've been too expensive so we combined lasercutted and 3D printed parts instead.*
![Image missing.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpalok/Digifab/gh-pages/Images/Mechanism.JPG "Mechanism") *For the mechanism we desided to make the moving part as small as possible so the servo could move it easily. Initial idea was to make it a disc, but that didn't work out.*
### Base
The base was made by Juho from MDF by laser cutting, using Inkscape and FabLabs laser cutter.
### Container
Container was made by Ville, using Fusion360, Inscape and FabLabs 3D printer and laser cutter.
### PCB
PCB was made by Joona, using Eagle and Roland SRM-20 mill.

### Software
Software was written by Kalle, using Microsoft Visual Studio and Xamarin Forms for the app, and Arduino IDE for Arduino.
