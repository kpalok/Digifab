# Week Nine; Summary report.

Our concept didn't change much along the way, only design choises were how to fabricate the actual food container and how the release mechanism should be designed. 
![Image missing.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpalok/Digifab/gh-pages/Images/ContainerProtoBooth.jpg "Container") *Initial idea was to 3D-print the whole container, but it would've been too expensive so we combined lasercutted and 3D-printed parts instead.*
![Image missing.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpalok/Digifab/gh-pages/Images/Mechanism.JPG "Mechanism") *For the mechanism we desided to make the moving part as small as possible so the servo could move it easily. Initial idea was to make it a disc, but that didn't work out.*
