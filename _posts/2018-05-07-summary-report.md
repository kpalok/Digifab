# Week Nine; Summary report.

Our concept didn't change much along the way, only design choices were how to fabricate the actual food container and how the release mechanism should be designed. 
![Image missing.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpalok/Digifab/gh-pages/Images/ContainerProtoBooth.jpg "Container") *Initial idea was to 3D print the whole container, but it would've been too expensive so we combined lasercutted and 3D printed parts instead.*
![Image missing.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kpalok/Digifab/gh-pages/Images/Mechanism.JPG "Mechanism") *For the mechanism we desided to make the moving part as small as possible so the servo could move it easily. Initial idea was to make it a disc, but that didn't work out.*
### Base
The base was made by Juho from MDF by laser cutting, using Inkscape and FabLabs laser cutter.
### Container
Container was made by Ville, using Fusion360, Inscape and FabLabs 3D printer and laser cutter.
### PCB
PCB was made by Joona, using Eagle and Roland SRM-20 mill.

### Software
Software was written by Kalle, using Microsoft Visual Studio and Xamarin Forms for the app, and Arduino IDE for Arduino.

The stages of development can be seen in our [diary report](https://kpalok.github.io/Digifab/2018/03/26/weekly-report.html).

*The final prototype in action*

All source files can be found in the [main branch](https://github.com/kpalok/Digifab/tree/master) of our repository.

### Lessons learned:

+ Usage of GitHub Pages and Git in general
+ Basic understanding of 3D modeling with Fusion 360 and the software used for 3D printing
+ Experience with Eagle application and PCB milling
+ How to cut parts using a laser cutter and Inkscape
+ Creating simple Android applications with Visual Studio and Xamarin Forms using C#
+ Basic Arduino programming
+ Usage of equipment and machinery in FabLab

The project demanded a lot of work but working continuously gave results. The most difficult part was probably learning to use all the design software. This is because none of the team members had any prior knowledge regarding the design or fabrication process needed to create the prototype. After this course, it's safe to say that we could confidently make a similar kind of project again.
