# Week Three

Things are being done, and after those things have been done, they will be reported on this page, which in itself is one thing that has been done. 

### Kalle:
I started to develop an Android application that could communicate with the arduino via the HC-05 Bluetooth module and control the motor of our prototype. I decided to develop the app whith Visual studio and Xamarin forms, because I'm interested in getting familiar with Visual studio. Source code for the app can be found [here.](https://github.com/kpalok/Digifab/tree/master/FeederApp) Early example of user interface below.

### Ville:
I started my week by familiriazing myself with GitHub Pages and Jekyll in order to update our web page. I also dove into Fusion 360 and used it to create a concept 3D model of our design. In the process I got a bit more comfortable with the basic Fusion workflow. After discovering Fusion's animation tools, I used them to create a short video demonstrating the basic functionality of our design:

### Juho:
