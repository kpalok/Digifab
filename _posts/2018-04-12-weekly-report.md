# Week Three

Things are being done, and after those things have been done, they will be reported on this page, which in itself is one thing that has been done. 

### Kalle:
I started to develop an Android application that could communicate with the arduino via the HC-05 Bluetooth module and control the motor of our prototype. I decided to develop the app whith Visual studio and Xamarin forms, because I'm interested in getting familiar with Visual studio. Source code for the app can be found [here.](https://github.com/kpalok/Digifab/tree/master/FeederApp) Early example of user interface below.
