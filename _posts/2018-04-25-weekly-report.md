# Week Seven

We 3D printed the base of the container of our design. This is the final result with the plexiglass walls in place:

The walls are a bit loose without any additional support so we will probably have to use some glue when we assemble the final prototype.

We finally got somewhere with the app after changing its functionality for a simpler approach. Initially our intention was to search for new devices and choose the correct one within the found devices, but it it got a bit too complicated and would've required a seperate interface for the connection process, so we settled with searching the desired bluetoothdevice from the host phones paired devices by its name. It also only makes an insecure connection so it wont work with all devices, but it's enough for our needs. More about the app can be found in our [repository.](https://github.com/kpalok/Digifab/tree/master/FeederApp)
