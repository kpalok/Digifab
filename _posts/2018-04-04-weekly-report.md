# Week two

We met up to design the example board for milling and to finish the introductory report and clarified our concept.

### Joona:
In the meeting I desinged the example board with Eagle. It turned out to be a bit harder than I tought. I used the instructions from Digital Fabrication's home page and mostly it showed nicely what to do next. It lacked some good information though e.g what if the image is not exporting correctly as I had thin white outlines on the cutout picture. I was instructed by Ivan to just fill them up with Gimp but it would have been nice to have that information in the instructions.I didn't really even thought about powering the example board so it doesn't have place to attach a battery. Also soldering proved to be a very difficult challenge for me. Here is the example board.
