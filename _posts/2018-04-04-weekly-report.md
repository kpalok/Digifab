# Week Two

We met up to design the example board for milling and to finish the introductory report and clarified our concept.

### Joona:
In the meeting I desinged the example board with Eagle. It turned out to be a bit harder than I tought. I used the instructions from Digital Fabrication's home page and mostly it showed nicely what to do next. It lacked some good information though e.g what if the image is not exporting correctly as I had thin white outlines on the cutout picture. I was instructed by Ivan to just fill them up with Gimp but it would have been nice to have that information in the instructions. I didn't think about powering the example board so it doesn't have place to attach a battery. Soldering proved to be difficult and definitely need to use tweezers next time. Here is the example board.

### Kalle:
Most of my efforts went into learning how to customize our documentation website with Markdown and Jekyll. I had some trouble with links to other pages and decided to change our sites Jekyll theme in the process.
