## Introductory report
### Remote controlled cat food dispenser.

One of our members who owns a cat had an idea about an automated cat food dispenser, which was our first decent idea so we decided to stick with it. The concept is to have a food dispenser that can have an user-interface either for the cat or the owner. For the cat there is an option to have a large pushbutton that dispenses one serving, and the primary UI for the owner is a phone app that controlls the dispenser via bluetooth.
